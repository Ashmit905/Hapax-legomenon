WHAT I LEARNED: In this Task, I have learned how to efficiently
allocate memory so that I can be faster when programming and I 
also got an important refresher on how linked lists work. Array double
is the fastest because it has the least amount of mallocs and everything
is sequential. Headonly is the slowest because you always have to go to the end of the
linked list, and lastly headtail is the 2nd fastest cause it knows where the tail
is so we can go directly to that.
